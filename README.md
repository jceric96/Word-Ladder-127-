## 127. Word Ladder

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.



Example 1:

Input: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], ball = [4,3], hole = [0,1]
Output: "lul"
Explanation: There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.
The first way is left -> up -> left, represented by "lul".
The second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.
Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because 'l' < 'u'. So the output is "lul".


Example 2:

Input: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], ball = [4,3], hole = [3,0]
Output: "impossible"
Explanation: The ball cannot reach the hole.



Example 3:

Input: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,1]], ball = [0,4], hole = [3,5]
Output: "dldr"


Constraints:

m == maze.length
n == maze[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
maze[i][j] is 0 or 1.
ball.length == 2
hole.length == 2
0 <= ballrow, holerow <= m
0 <= ballcol, holecol <= n
Both the ball and the hole exist in an empty space, and they will not be in the same position initially.
The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces.
